          You may have noticed that while I&apos;m doing something like
          listening to Spotify, programming in VSCode or playing a game,
          it&apos;ll appear in the bottom left of my site. This is thanks to an
          open-source project called{" "}
          <Link href={"https://github.com/phineas/lanyard"}>Lanyard</Link> which
          pulls live presences from Discord and updates an API and WebSocket
          service. It takes {"<10"} seconds to set up, you just have to join a
          Discord server!
